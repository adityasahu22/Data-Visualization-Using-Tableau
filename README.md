Tableau: Tableau is one of the fastest evolving business intelligence and data visualization tool. 
It is easy to deploy data from different data sources like Sql server, Hadoop/Hive, Teradata and from Flat files. In Tableau, we have different types of chart like Histogram, 
Side by side, Scatterplot, and Bubble chart etc. Dimensions and measures are two different categories used to represent aggregate and non-aggregate functions. We can work with multiple data sources using data blending concept. Sometimes Sql queries are used to retrieve the data from data set.
